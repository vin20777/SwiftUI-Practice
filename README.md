# SwiftUI Practice

## Platform Requirements
1. MacOS 10.15 or above
2. Xcode 11 or above

## Pros and Cons
1. Write UI in Swift instead of interface builder (IB) which reduced conflicts in source control, but a big difference when construction.
2. Easier to reuse the UI components since it now written in Swift code.
3. Faster preview through the panel without running the simulator.
4. Still only apply for iOS platform, unlike other cross-platform reactive programming languages (Ex. ReactNative, Flutter, etc)
